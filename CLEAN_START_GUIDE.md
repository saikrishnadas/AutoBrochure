## 🚀 How to Start Clean

### Option 1: Fresh Database Setup
If you haven't run the schema yet:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `sql/schema.sql` - this now creates clean tables with no test data
3. Start using the app immediately

### Option 2: Clean Existing Database
If you have existing test data:
1. Go to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run `sql/clean-database.sql` to remove all existing data
3. Optionally run `sql/schema.sql` again to ensure everything is set up
4. Start fresh

## 📋 Step-by-Step Clean Start
